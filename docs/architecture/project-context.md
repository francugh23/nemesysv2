# PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
# NEMESYS v2

## Document Purpose

This document is the repository's current operational state. It is not implementation history. Load the relevant milestone document under [`milestones/`](./milestones/) for completed feature decisions, validation, verification, and deferred work.

## Current Development Status

### Current Milestone

No active implementation milestone. Audit Log Modernization Phase 16B is complete.

### Current Objective

No active implementation objective. Audit Log Management now provides authorized read-only server-driven listing and details of immutable audit history, with validated query reuse prepared for future export work.

### Completed Modules

- Student CRUD, UI, import, and URL-driven server-table UX
- Teacher CRUD and URL-driven server-table UX
- Subject CRUD, identity correction, archive, import, and URL-driven server-table UX
- Shared CRUD toolbar and backward-compatible client/server DataTable infrastructure
- Subject Assignment foundation, creation, view, edit, and archive
- Section Management foundation, creation, view, edit, archive, and URL-driven server-table UX
- Enrollment Management foundation, lifecycle completion, controlled correction, and URL-driven server-table UX
- User Management authorized read path, URL-driven server-table UX, and audited administrative account creation, editing, password reset, status, and role administration
- Audit Log Management read-only URL-driven server-table UX, authorized details, represented filters, immutable historical actor visibility, and export-ready validated query reuse
- Security Hardening Phase S1 centralized authorization architecture
- Security Hardening Phase S2 active-account revalidation
- Security Hardening Phase S3 immediate production security

## Current Architecture

- Application flow: `Component -> Server Action -> Service -> Repository -> Prisma -> PostgreSQL`.
- Components are presentation-only and use hooks for server state.
- Server Actions validate input, enforce action-level authorization, call services, and return structured responses.
- Services own business rules, authorization orchestration, transactions, and audit coordination.
- Repositories perform Prisma data access only; related writes and audit records commit or roll back together in service-owned transactions.
- Hooks own TanStack Query integration and narrowly invalidate affected query keys.
- Protected Server Actions and Services independently enforce centralized module permissions; repositories remain authorization-free.
- Central authorization performs one request-scoped active-user lookup and evaluates permissions using the current database role.
- Production responses apply standard browser security headers; authenticated route families and APIs are private and non-cacheable.
- Auth.js retains encrypted JWT sessions with an explicit 8-hour maximum age and default secure cookie behavior.
- Production startup validates required secrets, database configuration, and any configured canonical Auth.js URL.
- Enrollment is the operational lifecycle source of truth. Student status and current Section are synchronized summaries maintained transactionally by `EnrollmentService`.
- Student current placement is normalized through nullable `currentSectionId`; grade, track/strand, shift, adviser, and other placement details are derived from Section.
- Enrollment is the reference implementation for URL-driven server tables. Shared components provide generic state and controls while feature modules retain query schemas, filters, sort mapping, repositories, services, and authorization.
- Student Management applies the same server-table architecture with Student-owned URL parameters, active-record search and filters, represented-value filter options, deterministic sorting, and server pagination.
- Teacher, Subject, and Section Management apply the same architecture with feature-owned query contracts, represented-value filters, deterministic server ordering, and prefix-based query invalidation.
- User Management applies the shared listing architecture to non-archived account metadata and supports audited creation and editing of Super Admin, Registrar, and Principal accounts. Teacher account creation and editing remain exclusively owned by Teacher Management.
- User creation generates eight-character temporary passwords through the shared cryptographic credential utility, hashes them with the existing bcrypt configuration, persists active first-login accounts with the audit record in one transaction, and reveals the temporary credential only in the immediate success dialog.
- User editing limits updates to approved identity and demographic fields, preserves uniqueness across archived rows, and commits changed-field audit metadata atomically with the account update.
- User administration uses dedicated transactional operations for password reset, role change, and activation/deactivation; Teacher-owned accounts remain excluded, actors cannot change their own role/status, and active Super Admin continuity is protected before role/status reductions.
- Audit Log Management applies the shared server-table architecture to immutable audit history. Reads preserve actor relationships even after User soft deletion, filter inclusive Philippine calendar dates, and never expose audit metadata or secret-bearing fields in list projections.
- Audit Log details use a separate authorized read path to load immutable metadata only when requested. Metadata is displayed structurally, changed fields are distinct when available, and the shared validated list-query parser is available to a future export action while Export remains disabled.
- Operational module headers own the primary Add or lifecycle action. Table toolbars contain search and filters on the left and only existing Import actions plus a disabled Export placeholder on the right.
- Stable architectural principles are maintained in [`.ai/context/architecture.md`](../../.ai/context/architecture.md).

## Active Constraints

- NEMESYS v2 serves one school; do not add multi-school tenancy without an explicit architectural decision.
- PostgreSQL is the system of record, and Prisma is the only application database access layer.
- Zod validates external input at system boundaries.
- Lifecycle-managed records use soft deletion. Active reads explicitly exclude archived records, and historical relations and audit records are preserved.
- Material mutations require transactional audit records with actor, operation, module, record identity, and a human-readable outcome.
- Third-party API proposals require authoritative MCP verification when available; otherwise use official documentation, installed types/source, or CLI output and record the fallback.

## Dependency Relationships

- Section Management provides active Section selection for Subject Assignment and Section placement for Student Enrolment.
- Sections and Subject Assignments are prerequisites for adviser assignment, class lists, attendance, and grades.
- Shared DataTable, CrudToolbar, import framework, and searchable selector infrastructure are reused by feature modules.

## Next Planned Milestone

No next milestone is active or approved. Password change and first-login completion workflows, MFA, recovery, User archive/restore, and complete filtered exports remain deferred to separately approved milestones.

## Technology Stack

- Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Lucide Icons
- TanStack Table and TanStack React Query
- Prisma and PostgreSQL
- SheetJS (`xlsx`) and Node.js

## Project Structure

The repository is feature-first with reusable UI centralized in `components/common` and Base UI primitives in `components/ui`. Main application layers are `app`, `actions`, `hooks`, `services`, `repositories`, `schemas`, `lib`, and `types`.
